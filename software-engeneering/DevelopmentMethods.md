# Software Development Methods

### SCRUM
This agile approach is more project
management-friendly than the others. The
scrum master manages the activities within
the project increment; each increment is
called a sprint and lasts no more than 30
days. A Product Backlog Item (PBI) list is
developed from which tasks are identified,
defined, prioritized, and estimated. A working version of the software is tested and
released in each increment. Daily scrum
meetings ensure work is managed to plan

### FDD Feature-Driven Development
This is a model-driven, short, iterative software development approach using
a five-phase process: (1) develop a product
model to scope the breadth of the domain, (2)
create the list of needs or features, (3) build
the feature development plan, (4) develop
designs for iteration-specific features, and
(5) code, test, and then integrate the features.
FDD is similar to an incremental software
development approach; it is also similar to
XP, except that code ownership is assigned
to individuals rather than the team. FDD
emphasizes an overall architectural approach
to the software, which promotes building the
feature correctly the first time rather than
emphasizing continual refactoring.

### XP - Extreme Programming
This approach uses stories or scenarios
for requirements, develops tests first, has
direct customer involvement on the team
(typically defining acceptance tests), uses
pair programming, and provides for continuous code refactoring and integration. Stories
are decomposed into tasks, prioritized, estimated, developed, and tested. Each increment of software is tested with automated
and manual tests; an increment may be
released frequently, such as every couple of
weeks or so.

### Cascade
Es un modelo de desarrollo lineal secuencial. El proyecto de software es dividido en fases que deben procederse en forma secuencial.
