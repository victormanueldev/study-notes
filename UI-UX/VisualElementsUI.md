### Visual Elements of UI Design

## UI
The user is the viewer or a person interacting with the content.
The interface is the way that the user gets to that content.
Interface is a bridge between the user and content.
Interface can shape the way that user gets the content, i.e.
reader -> book -> story
Book is a interface and it is be able to change the way that the user gets the 
story (content).

The interface shape the experience.
Interface is the UI part, and the experience is the UX part.

## Relationship Between UI/UX

*UI*
How it looks
(inteface)
Visual design
Design Driven
Tangible

*UX*
How it feels
(experience)
non-visual design
User driven
Propositional

Historicly. the interface desing was thought in order to connect the user with the content, ie a ATM
is ver simply interaction between the user and the money. 
In this point, is necesary return a feedback to user when it does anything in the system.
Besides, is important that the user be able to cancel in order to fix a mistake, and be able to
send or validate its interaction getting a feedback as well.  

## Interface conventions theory

**Real world knowledge**
Is based in analog models, there were simulations of phisical things or objects that
exists in the real world. You recognize the buttons because you have experienced analog buttons.
is based on analog models. For example, we understand the functionality of digital buttons on a screenbecause we’ve experienced analog buttons in the real world—on calculators, remote controls, elevators, and so on.

**Learned Behaviour**
Press a button because you know how digital buttons works.
If real world knowledge is based on analog models, then perhaps you can say learned behavior is based on digital models. For instance, swiping left or right is a digital convention that is now fairly common among plenty of apps, but has no corollary in the real world. It is an action users have picked up from using smartphones and the apps on them.

**Cause and Effect**
Looks at action and reaction. Press a button and something happends.
is about action and reaction. When a user presses a button and something happens, they quickly understand the functionality of the button. For example, pressing “Send” to send an email message, or “Submit” to submit a form.

**Consistency**
Logic or Systematic approach to design. Press another button and you know what will happen.
Keep the form and aestethic of a button for instance, and the user will know what will happen
when it press one.
is about applying a systematic logic to the way interfaces look and function so they remain familiar to a user. For example, on a telephone keypad, where all of the numbered buttons look the same, you can anticipate that pressing the number “8” will have more or less the same function as pressing the number “1”.

**Seamless**
(Continuo) should be fast and easy.
is about ensuring that the action and reaction are closely linked. The interaction should be easy (with as few steps as possible), and results should be immediate.

**Immediate intuition**
A few interactions teach a lot.Know this button and Know all buttons works.
We’ve been conditioned that in order to interact with an interface we need to touch it in some way. While the system may not be immediately obvious, the solution is usually quickly discovered.

**Fulfillment**
Payoff or Results.If i take the time to press the button, I expect something in return.
is the payoff for the user! An interface should function as it was intended, but there are other ways to reaffirm it as a positive experience. Anyone who uses Mailchimp to send email to a list of customers is likely familiar with the “Freddie High Five” that appears after you send a campaign.


**Undo/Redo**
The user wants to feel safe. The user should be able to undo or redo its actions.
gives the user peace of mind that their actions are reversible. A good UI will allow a user to change their mind after they’ve made an action, or at least notify the user before they take a crucial step. You can see a few examples of this in Google’s webmail service, Gmail, from notifying you if you’ve possibly forgotten to attach a document to an outgoing email, to giving you a short window of time to “undo” a sent message before it leaves your outbox.

## Design before design
Before making anything, we need to describe the accurate project description.
It is possible, answering these questions:
- What is it
- Who is it for
- Where does it live or where the project are build (Web, App, etc...)
We must be clear about goals, constraints, platform and audience, and this things
are determined by the clien

Example of project:
https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/JS5c3P2gEei5Kg7DUflKxA_255014c0fda011e891270765d8b4cf4e_Project_Example_SeeCells1.pdf?Expires=1589500800&Signature=Buwbbut2DlLIyYmAh~Z4mAlxYT9VGiRI2xSfwFAfVia5W8O~AF2IJJDsIg8ESUWWw69pS-Lh1tHCXVqN9BgCFIFXogJK2reylFTe~jbg-qrKzKCx5RI8fpeuy8X-VHK1zKHAqbTl4Hjsf5tk2szqfeQyw-hMbfwjNiJYAtZH5PM_&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLTNE6QMUY6HBC5A

## Look amd Feel
We can think about look and feel as the Style and Mood of the project
The UI Designer have to be able to visualize the invisible.
To achieve that we can start with Style Boards. This is a board with a visual info
researched based on the project brief, we can find images, we can to pick colors and 
build our project color palette

## Language as a Design tool
Using words, we can describe our ideas end name that. With words we can identify or know how does it feel.
We could use words to describe the overall tone and attitude
Take a set of words that describe our look and feel proposal. We could use these words, put together and
get a name for the app.

## Color and Shape
Color, can help define the mood or attitude of the product and besides, can help how a user would 
navigate or interact with an interface.
The shapes, can be functional parts of an interface such as form fields or buttons
and can be illustrative design elements to help augment the look and feel of the interface.

### Imagery
So, our imagery is doing multiple things at the same time.
It's acting as mood,
it's acting is part of the interface,
but it's also the content in this case as well,
because it's the map itself,
and the cars and the accidents,
and everything that we want to see.
So, you can see that happening here in this interface designed by one of my students,
where it's purely an image based interface

### Typography
